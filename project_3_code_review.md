## Proper Data Science:

- Very good selecting the best model, RF, and trying to tune and find the best parameter for this model.
- Was there an issue of class imbalance? If yes, how did you resolve?
- Loved the engineering features using domain knowledge. Looking forward to seeing future work on this topic
